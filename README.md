</div>

To get started you need:

- A container to inject the autosuggest into
- An [OpenCage geosearch](https://opencagedata.com/geosearch) key (available when you become a geosearch customer)
- To specify the domain for the `access-control-allow-origin` HTTP header (commonly known as a CORS header) in your [OpenCage account dashboard](https://opencagedata.com/dashboard) in the "Geosearch" tab.

This library comes as a plugin on [Algolia's Autocomplete](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete), which creates an input and provides the interactivity and accessibility attributes.

By configuring the two required parameters (`container` and `key`), and configuring the CORS header in your OpenCage dashboard you can have an interactive geosearch experience for places (countries, states/provinces, cities/towns/villages, suburbs/neighbourhoods, major POIS) around the world.

**Note**: to learn more about this service please see the [OpenCage geosearch site](https://opencagedata.com/geosearch) (especially the [FAQ section](https://opencagedata.com/geosearch#faq)).

## Example

![header](/resources/screenshot-results-berlin.png)

See a configurable, [live demo on the OpenCage site](https://opencagedata.com/geosearch/demo), or play with the html/css/js [on codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/oEMyOj).

We also have tutorials/examples for integration on a map:
[Leaflet](https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/leaflet-location-search),
[OpenLayers](https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/openlayers-location-search),
[MapLibre](https://codepen.io/opencage/pen/JjaepyE).

## Usage

For convenience, this repository is published as multiple [packages](#packages). For a simple usage, we bundle it with the [Algolia's Autocomplete](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete).
To get started, with a simple HTML page, you need a container to anchor the geosearch into:

```html
<div id="place"></div>
```

Then, insert your search experience into it by calling the `algoliaAutocomplete` function, providing :

- The container (a CSS selector)
- The OpenCage Geosearch API `key`

Make sure to provide a container (e.g., a div), not an input. The Geosearch generates a fully accessible search box.

Please note: a geosearch key is unrelated to the keys for the OpenCage geocoding API. Geosearch keys are of the form `oc_gs_...` and will need to be configured for a specific domain in your OpenCage account dashboard.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  opencage.algoliaAutocomplete({
    container: '#place',
    plugins: [
      opencage.OpenCageGeoSearchPlugin(
        {
          key: 'YOUR-GEOSEARCH-KEY',
        },
        // optional event handlers:
        {
          onSelect: function handleSelect(params) {
            console.log('Selected Item is', params.item);
            const latlng = [params.item.geometry.lat, params.item.geometry.lng];
            // do something with the coords
            console.log('Selected result coords', latlng);
          },
          onSubmit: function handleSubmit(params) {
            // Do something with the selected and then submitted value
            console.log('Submit with', params.state.query);
          },
        }
      ),
    ],
  });
</script>
```

and to run it, just add the following resources to the header of the HTML page:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@opencage/geosearch-bundle/dist/css/autocomplete-theme-classic.min.css"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@opencage/geosearch-bundle"></script>
```

### Optional configuration

```js
opencage.OpenCageGeoSearchPlugin(options, events);
```

#### 1. Options

In addition to the mandatory `key` parameter, the following optional parameters may also be set

- `bounds` - restricts the possible results to a defined bounding box.

The value of the bounds parameter should be specified as two coordinate points forming the south-west and north-east corners of a bounding box (min longitude, min latitude, max longitude, max latitude).

Example usage:
`bounds: '-0.563160,51.280430,0.278970,51.683979'`

Values that are not valid coordinates are ignored. We have built [a small, map-based tool to easily see bounds values](https://opencagedata.com/bounds-finder).

- `countrycode` - restricts results to the specified country/territory.

The country code is a two letter code as defined by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 standard. E.g. `gb` for the United Kingdom, `fr` for France, `us` for United States.

Example usage:
`countrycode: 'de'`

Non-two letter country codes are ignored.

- `language` - language to display results in.

A two letter language code (such as `es` for Spanish or `de` for German), or `native` in which case we will attempt to return the response in the local language.
Currently supported languages are: `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`.

Example usage:
`language: 'de'`

If no language is explicitly specified, we default to English `en`.

We hope to add more languages in the future. Please get in touch if lack of a certain language is preventing you from becoming a customer.

- `limit` - maximum number of results the autosuggest should display.

Default is 5. Maximum allowable value is 10.

Example usage:
`limit: 3`

- `debounce` - sets the time (in ms) to pass without any typing before doing a request to the API.

Default is 300.

Example usage:
`debounce: 250`

- `noResults` - sets the label to display when the API returns no results (it is i18n).

Default is `No results.`.

Example usage:
`noResults: 'Pas de rÃ©sultat.'`

### 2. Events

- `onActive` - callback function called whenever a result is active.

By default, this is an empty function.

Function parameter type:

```js
(params:
  { state: AutocompleteState,
  ...setters,
  event: Event,
  item: TItem,
  itemInputValue: string,
  itemUrl: string,
  source: AutocompleteSource }
  ) => void
```

- `onSelect` - callback function called whenever a result is selected.

By default, this is an empty function.

Function parameter type:

```js
(params:
  { state: AutocompleteState,
  ...setters,
  event: Event,
  item: TItem,
  itemInputValue: string,
  itemUrl: string,
  source: AutocompleteSource }
  ) => void`| defaults to`({ setIsOpen }) => setIsOpen(false)
```

- `onSubmit` - callback function called when submitting the form.

By default, this is an empty function.

Function parameter type:

```js
(params:
  { state: AutocompleteState,
  event: Event,
  ...setters }
  ) => void
```

## Issues

Find a bug or want to request a new feature? Please let us know by submitting [an issue](https://github.com/OpenCageData/geosearch/issues).

## Please Note

Geosearch is an entirely different service than geocoding. OpenCage also operates a [forward and reverse geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/api), please don't confuse the geosearch service with the geocoding API.
